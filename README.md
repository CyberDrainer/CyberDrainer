### Hello there, I hope you like my projects!

üòÑ Almost all these run on community donations. So if you want to donate, please don't hesitate to do so. It will help me a lot to continue developing stuff like this.

### I am also currently available for hire!

#### Need a developer who can make Crypto/NFT Wallet Drainers? Or is there any other custom development jobs that you want to complete? I am that guy! I am a full-stack developer and have years of experience developing and building web3 stuff. And most of the time, I make my projects public. So if you like any of it, feel free to give it a star and consider donating a bit! It helps me a lot to continue doing what I love.
